      "## Abstract\n",
      "This paper presents a novel algorithm named Bregman Operator Splitting with Variable Stepsize (BOSVS) for minimizing optimization problems of the form involving nonsmooth functions. The traditional Bregman Operator Splitting (BOS) method utilizes a fixed stepsize, while BOSVS adopts a line search strategy to improve efficiency, particularly in applications related to total variation-based image reconstruction. The algorithm begins with a Barzilai-Borwein (BB) step and adapts the stepsize until a stopping condition is met. The performance of this approach is evaluated against other operator splitting methods, particularly in the context of partially parallel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where BOSVS proved to be more efficient compared to the fixed stepsize and another method known as SBB (Split Bregman Barzilai-Borwein).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Introduction\n",
      "The paper discusses the significance of image reconstruction techniques in computer science and engineering. The methodology focuses on minimizing a functional which consists of a fidelity term associated with data and a regularization term. The specific problem tackled involves total variation (TV) regularization, which is notably effective in preserving image edges while reducing noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Proposed Algorithm\n",
      "The BOSVS algorithm builds on principles found in previous works by combining variable splitting with the alternating direction method of multipliers. The innovation lies in employing a line search for the stepsize, which can lead to faster convergence and more reliable results than fixed stepsize methods. The proposed algorithm includes an adjustment for proximal terms and optimizes the objective function iteratively.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Convergence Analysis\n",
      "The authors establish a framework for the global convergence of the BOSVS algorithm. They provide theoretical insights into the selection of stepsizes and show that, under specific conditions, the algorithm converges to a solution effectively. \n",
      "\n",
      "## Numerical Experiments\n",
      "BOSVS is tested using three datasets from partially parallel MRI systems. The experimental results highlight the advantages of the algorithm, which demonstrate faster convergence, lower objective function values, and reduced computation time compared to existing algorithms. The results affirm the algorithm's robustness and effectiveness in large-scale imaging problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "The Bregman Operator Splitting with Variable Stepsize (BOSVS) introduces an improved method for total variation image reconstruction, showcasing better performance over traditional approaches. The research supports the potential of variable stepsize techniques to enhance optimization in imaging applications, making the BOSVS algorithm a promising tool in the field of medical imaging and signal processing.\n",
